# NodePort: Exposes a service on a specific port on each node, allowing external access to the service.
#  how to access--> ip:nodePort  (ip--> ip of any worker node in cluster.)
# allow inbound traffic custom-tcp on sg of eks-cluster on nodePort or range of nodePorts

# how it works?
# ip:nodePort --> cluster-ip of the service --> pods attached to that service based on selectors.
