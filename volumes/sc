**Definition** A StorageClass is a Kubernetes resource that defines how storage volumes should be provisioned, specifying the type of storage, provisioning method, and other storage parameters.

**Provisioning** what kind of volumes we are using for dynamic provisioning is defined in "provisioner".
 SC has type of volume, PVC has the storage required, so k8 creates the volume(in case of ebs) and PV and bound to PVC.

**Reclaim Policy** same as PV(by default retain), but here by default delete

**VolumeBindingMode** Determines how PVs are bound to PVCs. The two options are:
Immediate: A PV is bound as soon as a PVC is created.
WaitForFirstConsumer: The PV is only bound when a pod is scheduled that will use the volume.
