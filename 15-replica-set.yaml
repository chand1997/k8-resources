# Pod is subset of ReplicaSet

#The only purpose of ReplicaSet is to make 3 replicas available all the time(even if we delete, it creates
#  automatically)

# If there is any update(new image), from nginx to nginx:stable-perl and we re-run command 
#     "kubectl apply -f 15-replica-set.yaml"
# it cannot detect changes and update the pods.

# In order to do that, we use "Deployment" object
