# if we want to do some task on every node of cluster or some targeted nodes(using selectors) on the 
# cluster, we use daemonset
# tasks including--> logs collection, node health checks, etc



# below we are basically collecting logs from /var/log from  filesystem of every node, using hostpath

# host path is kind a volume which is used to mount path from node filesystem to particular container
# in pod

# since we are using hostpath(direct access to node's filesystem we should give readOnly)
