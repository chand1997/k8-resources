* When we give "kubectl apply -f file.yaml", the scheduler in eks-control plane decides on which node 
the pod should be scheduled.

* if we want to decide where the pod should be scheduled, we use some selectors namely,
nodeSelector, taints & tolerations, nodeAffinity, podAffinity and podAntiAffinity.


* NodeSelector is hard rule, i.e the pod is scheduled if and only if there is a worker-node in that
particular az and it should have resources, otherwise the pod status will be "Pending".

* Assume 2 worker-nodes in az mentioned in nodeSelector, one is tainted(and pod has tolerations) but
 has no resource, other one is not tainted, in this case pod will be scheduled on untainted node.
 Tolerations without taint is useless.

* Assume 3 nodes, 2 nodes are tainted with(lets say key=value:NoExecute)and pod also has same 
tolerations in pod definition and no nodeSelector, but 2 nodes doesnt have resource, then pod will be
scheduled on 3rd node.
  again Tolerations without taint is useless.
